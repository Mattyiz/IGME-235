    Add a High Concept: A 1-3 sentence description that pitches and summarizes your game. Examples in link below.
    Genre: Identify the genre(s) the experience belongs to. There are sample lists of genres provided in the link below.
    Platform: Desktop web, mobile web, both, other?
    Story: Is it purely abstract or is there a deeper premise/theme/narrative/motivation?
    Aesthetics: How would you describe the desired graphic style... You might not make it there, but what are you aiming
    for?
    Gameplay: Discuss what choices the player will be able to make and what kind of control they have to make those
    choices. How will the player learn how to play?
    Mockups: Provide at least 2 mockup screens of the game. They can be hand-drawn sketches captured on a phone camera,

    <h1>Invasion</h1>

    <h2>The High Concept</h2>
    <p>In this game you have to protect something from objects coming in from the sides of the screen. This will be similar to the Undyne fight in Undertale.</p>

    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <p>The genre is bullet hell</p>

    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>Desktop</p>

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The story is that you have to angle the deflector shield of a city to protect it from alien invaders</p>

    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>The graphic style will be very simple. Bright "neon" colors for most things. The city will likely be the only exception.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>The player will control a line and the will be able to rotate it around an objective with their mouse.
        <br>Objects will fly in from the side of the screen and the player will have to hit them to prevent them frm hitting the objective.</p>

    <h2>Mockups</h2>
    <img src="Mockup1.png" alt="This is the near the beginning of the game">
    <img src="Mockup2.png" alt="This is closer to the end of the game">

    <h2>Other</h2>
    <p>I'm not sure what I'm going to use, but I want to try with pixiJs and basically all of the tools of Circle Blast. This is likely to change though.</p>

    <h2>About the Developer</h2>
    <p>I'm Matt Izzo, a 2nd year GDD major. I love playing and making games. I prefer to use C# or Java, but making a Javascript game is a nice change of pace.</p>
