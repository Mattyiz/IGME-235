        <p>In case you couldn't tell I am named "Matt Izzo". I was a second year GDD student at the time I made this and I hail from Little Silver NJ. 
            My favorite video games are Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga, basically anything in the Fire Emblem franchise, Super Mario Galaxy, Xenoblade Chronicles, and it probably used to be a Pokemon game, but then I became a GDD student and can legally
            not like poorly made games. Once I graduate I would ideally be doing some crazy complicated programming work at a game company, like writing a phsyics engine or something, but frankly I'm not picky. Any programming job will do for me.
